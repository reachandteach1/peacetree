# peacetree
A peacetree responds to tweets with the hashtags #peace and #peacetree and lights up a strand of neopixels based on twitter activity. The code is written for an Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 accessing a publicly accessible MQTT feed residing at io.adafruit.com . A valid free account and api key must be created at io.adafruit.com in order for this code to work.

Download peacetree_dist.zip and unzip the file into your Arduino sketch directory. Open the peacetree_dist sketch under IDE and modify the username and aio key as setup at the io.adafruit.com website.

The peacetree public data feed is located at: https://io.adafruit.com/reachandteach/feeds/peacetree. Feel free to use that feed to drive other applications. A document describing how this feed number is calculated is forthcoming soon.
